This is code, notes, and snippets about React

All React component names must start with a capital letter. If you start a component name with a lowercase letter, it will be treated like a built-in element like a `<div>` or a `<span>` . This is because of the way JSX works. In JSX, rendering a component that begins with a lowercase letter compiles down to React.
