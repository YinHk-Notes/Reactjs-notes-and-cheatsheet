## useCallback

useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
  
his allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.

The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

use the `useCallback` hook to prevent the function from being recreated unless necessary.
